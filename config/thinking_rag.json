All **noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)**\u2014error-prone, no fault-tolerant logical qubits.\n- **Requirements for Bitcoin Break**:\n  - Shor on secp256k1: ~2,300\u201320M **logical qubits** (error-corrected); runtime ~hours\u2013weeks on ideal hardware.\n  - Current: ~100 physical qubits \u2192 1 logical qubit (high overhead).\n- **Progress Metrics**:\n  | Metric | Current (2024) | Required |\n  |--------|----------------|----------|\n  | Logical Qubits | ~1\u201310 | 1M+ |\n  | Error Rate | 0.1\u20131% per gate | <0.001% |\n  | Scale | 100s physical | Billions physical |\n\n**Insight**: No credible threat before 2030\u20132035; hype overstated (e.g., Google's 2019 \"supremacy\" was narrow).\n\n## Timeline and Feasibility\n- **Optimistic (Aggressive Scaling)**: Fault-tolerant quantum by 2030 (e.g., PsiQuantum roadmap); Bitcoin break by 2035.\n- **Realistic**: 2040+ due to scaling walls (cryogenics, error correction overhead >1,000x).\n- **Pessimistic**: Indefinite (quantum error correction undecidable in some models).\n- **Black Swan Risks**: State actors (China/US) achieve breakthrough; open-source code accelerates.\n\n**Implication**: \"Quantum winter\" possible if progress stalls, mirroring fusion energy delays.\n\n## Potential Mitigations and Upgrades\nBitcoin's decentralized nature enables **soft forks** for upgrades:\n- **Post-Quantum Signatures**: LAMPORT, Dilithium (NIST-standardized lattice-based), Falcon, SPHINCS+.\n  - Proposals: **BIP-340+** (Schnorr \u2192 PQ variants); **Quantum-Resistant Addresses** (hash-based like Winternitz).\n- **Migration Path**:\n  1. Users move funds to PQ-secure addresses (reveals old pubkey\u2014timed carefully).\n  2. Protocol-level: Commit-delay-reveal for key rotation.\n- **Challenges**: 21M BTC cap; consensus needed (e.g., Taproot took years).\n- **Defenses in Place**: ~75% BTC in unexposed addresses today.\n\n**Insight**: Proactive upgrade cheaper than reaction; Ethereum exploring similar (STARKs).\n\n## Implications for Bitcoin Ecosystem\n| Stakeholder | Key Risks | Opportunities |\n|-------------|-----------|---------------|\n| **HODLers** | Theft of exposed UTXOs (~$200B at risk). | Migrate to PQ wallets. |\n| **Exchanges/Miners** | Key theft > 51% attacks; price crash. | Hot wallets vulnerable first. |\n| **Network** | Temporary loss of trust; fork wars. | Catalyzes innovation (PQ layer). |\n| **Global** | Undermines \"sound money\" narrative if unaddressed. | Positions BTC as adaptive (vs. fiat). |\n\n- **Economic**: 10\u201320% supply theft \u2192 50%+ price drop; recovery via social layer.\n- **Strategic**: Accelerates layer-2 (Lightning) with PQ channels.\n\n## Actionable Recommendations\n- **Users**:\n  - Audit addresses: Move exposed UTXOs to Taproot/P2TR now.\n  - Use hardware wallets with PQ firmware (e.g., future Trezor updates).\n- **Developers/Community**:\n  - Prioritize **BIP for PQ-Schnorr** (target 2025 activation).\n  - Simulate attacks via Qiskit/Cirq.\n- **Institutions**:\n  - Stress-test custody with Grover (hash searches).\n  - Lobby NIST for Bitcoin-specific PQ standards.\n- **Timeline Priority**: 2025\u20132027: Prototype forks; 2028+: Mandatory migration.\n\n## Conclusion\nQuantum poses a **medium-term, addressable threat**\u2014not apocalyptic, but demands urgency. Bitcoin's scriptable, upgradable design provides resilience; inaction risks \"quantum bank run.\" **Key Takeaway**: Act now on exposed funds; community consensus will secure the future.

IBM Condor (1,121 qubits), Google Willow (~100 logical qubits planned). Error rates: 0.1\u20131% per gate (needs <0.001% for fault-tolerance).\n- **Progress Milestones**:\n  - 2023: Google/IBM achieve ~100 logical qubits in small demos.\n  - No scalable error correction yet; \"Q-Day\" (cryptographically relevant QC) estimated 2030\u20132040 by NIST/NSA.\n- **Leaders**: IBM (roadmap to 100K qubits by 2026), Google (Sycamore), IonQ/Quantinuum (trapped ions). China lags slightly but advancing.\n- **Bottlenecks**: Cryogenics, qubit coherence (microseconds), scaling error-corrected logical qubits (needs 1,000\u201310,000 physical per logical).\n\n## Timeline Projections\n| Year | Expected QC Capabilities | Bitcoin Threat Feasibility |\n|------|---------------------------|----------------------------|\n| **2026** | 5K\u2013100K physical qubits (IBM roadmap); 10\u201350 logical qubits demos. No fault-tolerant scaling. | **Impossible**: Lacks qubits/depth for Shor. Best-case: Proof-of-concept on toy problems. |\n| **2029** | 1M+ physical qubits; 100\u20131,000 logical qubits possible if scaling accelerates (optimistic: PsiQuantum/Atom Computing claims). Fault-tolerance emerging. | **Plausible but unlikely**: Requires 10x+ breakthroughs in error correction. Expert consensus: 10\u201320% chance of \"crypto-relevant\" QC. |\n\n- **Optimistic Forecasts**: Google (2029 surface code scaling); RAND (2035 median for RSA-2048 break).\n- **Pessimistic**: 2040+ due to physical limits (e.g., decoherence).\n- Historical Overoptimism: QC timelines slipped 20+ years since 1990s.\n\n## Likelihood Assessment: 2026 vs. 2029\n| Metric | 2026 Likelihood | 2029 Likelihood | Rationale |\n|--------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|\n| **Existential Threat** (break chain-wide) | <0.1% | 1\u20135% | 2026: No fault-tolerant QC. 2029: Early prototypes possible but under-resourced for Bitcoin-scale attacks. |\n| **Targeted Attack** (steal exposed keys) | 0.01% | 0.5\u20132% | State actors (e.g., China/US) prioritize; but detection risks exposure. |\n| **Harvest-Now-Decrypt-Later** | Negligible | Low (5%) | Bitcoin public keys not routinely harvested; focus on TLS/RSA. |\n\n- **2026 Edge**: Near-zero; aligns with IBM's 2026 goal (non-fault-tolerant).\n- **2029 Delta**: 10\u201350x higher due to compounding progress, but still <10% per MIT/Quantum Insider surveys (expert median: 2033).\n- **Wildcards**: +20% if hybrid classical-quantum attacks evolve; -50% if physical scaling plateaus.\n\n## Mitigations and Bitcoin Resilience\n- **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)**: NIST standards (Dilithium, Falcon) ready. Bitcoin can migrate via:\n  | Method | Timeline | Trade-offs |\n  |--------|----------|------------|\n  | **Taproot/Schnorr** (2021) | Immediate prep | Enables PQC sigs in soft fork. |\n  | **Quantum-Resistant Forks** (e.g., QRAMP) | 2025\u20132027 | Hard fork needed; community split risk. |\n  | **Address Migration** | User-driven | Move to PQC addresses; 90%+ BTC safe today. |\n- **Bitcoin Advantages**: Decentralized, upgradeable (SegWit precedent), no central CA.
