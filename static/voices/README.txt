CHATTERBOX VOICE REFERENCES
===========================

Add your voice reference audio files here for Chatterbox TTS voice cloning.

Requirements:
- Format: WAV, MP3, FLAC, or OGG
- Duration: 10+ seconds recommended for best quality
- Content: Clear speech without background noise
- Suggested: Use a single speaker recording

File Naming:
- Use descriptive names like "sarah_warm.wav" or "male_professional.wav"
- The filename (without extension) will be displayed as the voice name in the UI

Examples:
- sarah.wav → "Sarah" in the voice selector

Tips for Best Results:
1. Use clean audio with minimal background noise
2. Include varied intonation and expression
3. Longer samples (15-30s) generally produce better cloning
4. Match the sample rate to your desired output (24kHz recommended)

You can use these tags in your text for expressive output:
- [laugh] - Laughter
- [chuckle] - Light chuckle
